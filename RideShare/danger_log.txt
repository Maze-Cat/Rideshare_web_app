2.3 Find two problems:
		1.Share_or_not field can be any arbitrary value, which is not possible to happen
		2.The receivers of the confirmation mail don't change

2.4 Fixed email issue.
 		The problem is because I used request.user.email instead of form.cleaned_data['email'],
 		the latter is the real data stored while the former is the local unsaved data.
